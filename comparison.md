Title: DSCI552 Final Project

----------------------------------

Note: I have used two notebooks to run the final project because running the first two models on my USC account exhausted all the GPU resources. So I had to run the other two models on another account.

The notebook named MLDS_FinalProject_DevenNabar1.ipynb contains the solution for 1c. CNN & 1d. ResNet50

And notebook named MLDS_FinalProject_DevenNabar2.ipynb contains the solution for 1d. VGG16 & 1d. EfficientNetB0

----------------------------------

Compare the results of transfer learning

the metrics of VGG16, ResNet50 and EfficienctNetB0 are all coming to be same

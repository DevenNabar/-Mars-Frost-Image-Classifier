# -Mars-Frost-Image-Classifier

This project, titled "Mars Frost Image Classifier," aims to develop a machine learning classifier capable of distinguishing between images of Martian terrain with and without frost. Utilizing the Keras framework and Python, the classifier processes a dataset of HiRISE images of Mars, which have been crucial in studying the planet's seasonal frost cycle and its impact on climate and surface evolution. The project involves data preprocessing, where images are organized into 'frost' and 'background' categories, and each image is transformed into smaller, annotated tiles. The core of the project consists of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), enhanced with techniques like image augmentation and transfer learning using pre-trained models such as EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG16. The goal is to develop an effective model that can accurately classify the images, contributing to the understanding of Martian climatology and topography.
